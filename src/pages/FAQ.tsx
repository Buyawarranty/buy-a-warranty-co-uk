New cars usually come with a manufacturer\'s warranty for about 3 years. After that, you\'re on your own unless you get an extended warranty. That\'s where we come in – giving you peace of mind and helping you avoid surprise bills.',

Our extended warranty helps protect you from unexpected costs – whether it\'s a breakdown, electrical fault or something else. We also include extras like roadside recovery, car hire and onward travel. It\'s all about making life easier and less stressful when things go wrong.'

It makes sure the warranty is being used for genuine unexpected faults rather than known issues. For example "Your car shows a fault on day 15 and a garage diagnoses it on day 20.
